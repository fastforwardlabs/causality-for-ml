# Causality for Machine Learning

This repo accompanies the prototype discussed in our [report](https://ff13.fastforwardlabs.com/), specifically the Invariant Risk Minimization approach discussed in chapter 3 & 4.

## Contents

Todo:
- create denoised dataset, this may require us to create a JSON file listing filenames that were actually used. Reuse some old code for this
- simply copy - main.py, train.py, models.py, dataset.py + changes
- think about model explanation - a CML code / notebook demostrating an example should be good enough?
